# fortigate-demo-ap-sdn

I use this template to maintain my Fortigate Active/Passive with Fabric connector demo environment.

This template deploys:
- A hub vnet and two spoke vnets with vnet peering
- An Active/Passive with Fabric connector FortiGate cluster
- Two Ubuntu VM's in each spoke for testing purposes
